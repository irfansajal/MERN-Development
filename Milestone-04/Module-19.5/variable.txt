What is variable in JS?
Ans :
 In JavaScript, a variable is a way to store a value or a reference to an object that can be changed during the execution of a program. The value stored in a variable can be of different types, such as a number, a string, or an object, and the type of a variable determines the operations that can be performed on it.
 JavaScript variables are declared using the keyword "var", "let" or "const".

The "var" keyword is used to declare variables that are accessible within the entire scope of the program, including the global scope.

The "let" keyword is used to declare variables that are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the block of code in which they are defined.

The "const" keyword is used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned after they are declared.

For example:
let x = 5; // declares a variable x and assigns it the value of 5
const y = "hello"; // declares a variable y and assigns it the value of "hello"
var z = true; // declares a variable z and assigns it the value of true
It's recommended to use "let" and "const" instead of "var" as they are more flexible and safer than "var"

2. How can change or update value of the variable?
Ans: In JavaScript, you can change the value of a variable by assigning a new value to it. This is done using the assignment operator (=).

For example:
let x = 5; // declares a variable x and assigns it the value of 5
x = 10; // assigns the value of 10 to the variable x
console.log(x); // prints 10
You can also change the value of a variable by using the various mathematical and assignment operators like "+=", "-=", "*=", "/=", "%=".

For example:

javascript
Copy code
let x = 5;
x += 3; // x = x + 3;
console.log(x); // prints 8
x *= 2; // x = x * 2;
console.log(x); // prints 16
If you declared a variable using "const", you can't reassign it but you can modify the properties of an object or array that the variable points to.

javascript
Copy code
const person = {name: "John", age: 25};
person.age = 30;
console.log(person); // prints {name: "John", age: 30}
It's important to keep in mind that JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, so you can reassign a variable to hold a value of a different type.

javascript
Copy code
let x = 5;
x = "hello"; // x now holds a string value
console.log(x); // prints "hello"
Also, keep in mind that if you are reassigning a variable inside a block that has already been defined with the same name, it will only affect the local scope of the block and not the global one.
